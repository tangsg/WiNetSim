Welcome to the Wireless Network Simulator (Wi\-Net\-Sim) {\bfseries Current Release} {\ttfamily v0.\-0}

supports Wifi 11ac 1 tx 1 rx over 20\-M\-Hz channel B\-W

provides both matlab, c++ and c++ multi threaded (for compute servers)

\subsection*{Future releases}

Support for All 802.\-11 and Mm Wave specs

\subsection*{Folders}

+\-C\-P\-P

+\-Matlab

\subsection*{Instructions to run C\-P\-P}

{\ttfamily cd C\-P\-P}

{\ttfamily mkdir build}

{\ttfamily cd build}

{\ttfamily cmake ../}

{\ttfamily make}

{\ttfamily ./\-Wi\-Net\-Sim}

\subsection*{Instructions to run Matlab}

open Matlab

{\ttfamily cd Matlab}

{\ttfamily main.\-m}

Refer the wiki \href{https://github.com/CommLabIITHyderabad/WiNetSim/wiki}{\tt https\-://github.\-com/\-Comm\-Lab\-I\-I\-T\-Hyderabad/\-Wi\-Net\-Sim/wiki} for more info {\bfseries Note\-:} Matlab version is very slow. Do not run large networks on Matlab. Use C\-P\-P version to run large networks like more than 100 nodes. There is a multi threaded version available to run on a compute cloud. Our experiments suggest single threaded version runs faster than a multi threaded version if your cpu has only 4 cores.
